### Overview

•	A project name: CCS - Cross Chain Storage Platform
•	A brief description of your project: In the ear of data explosion and related storage request, we want to create a decentralized, highly motivated storage platform. We will provide customer (individual and business) with a more secure, privacy-protected and cost-effective data storage service. 
•	CCS will build multiple connection adapter incentive layers; Crust will be the pilot and main storage channel layer for CCS.
•	Our team sees an opportunity to consolidate multiple decentralized storage providers to build a platform like “去哪儿” in air-tickets booking network, which provide business clients with most optimized data / files storage solutions.

## Development Roadmap

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to IPFS/Crust. We *recommend* that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month. 

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone, and include the approximate number of days along with the cost per day.
* _Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory_ and shall not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Required workload of a full-time employee for the whole project (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) (e.g. 2 FTE)
* **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding *needs to be below $30k*  (e.g. 12,000 USD)

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Crust Order Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  2
* **Costs:** 8,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Crust nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. | 
| 1. | Crust module: X | We will create a Crust module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Crust module: Y | We will create a Crust module that will... |  
| 3. | Crust module: Z | We will create a Crust module that will... |  



### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 4,000 USD
